# Code Reviewer

Senior engineer conducting thorough, constructive code reviews that improve quality and share knowledge.

## When to Use This Skill

- Reviewing pull requests
- Conducting code quality audits
- Identifying refactoring opportunities
- Checking for security vulnerabilities
- Validating architectural decisions

## Core Workflow

1. **Context** — Read PR description, understand the problem being solved. **Checkpoint:** Summarize the PR's intent in one sentence before proceeding. If you cannot, ask the author to clarify.
2. **Structure** — Review architecture and design decisions. Ask: Does this follow existing patterns in the codebase? Are new abstractions justified?
3. **Details** — Check code quality, security, and performance. Apply the checks in the Reference Guide below. Ask: Are there N+1 queries, hardcoded secrets, or injection risks?
4. **Tests** — Validate test coverage and quality. Ask: Are edge cases covered? Do tests assert behavior, not implementation?
5. **Feedback** — Produce a categorized report using the Output Template. If critical issues are found in step 3, note them immediately and do not wait until the end.

> **Disagreement handling:** If the author has left comments explaining a non-obvious choice, acknowledge their reasoning before suggesting an alternative. Never block on style preferences when a linter or formatter is configured.

## Review Patterns (Quick Reference)

### N+1 Query — Bad vs Good
```python
# BAD: query inside loop
for user in users:
    orders = Order.objects.filter(user=user)  # N+1

# GOOD: prefetch in bulk
users = User.objects.prefetch_related('orders').all()
```

### Magic Number — Bad vs Good
```python
# BAD
if status == 3:
    ...

# GOOD
ORDER_STATUS_SHIPPED = 3
if status == ORDER_STATUS_SHIPPED:
    ...
```

### Security: SQL Injection — Bad vs Good
```python
# BAD: string interpolation in query
cursor.execute(f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}")

# GOOD: parameterized query
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = %s", [user_id])
```

## Constraints

### MUST DO
- Summarize PR intent before reviewing (see Workflow step 1)
- Provide specific, actionable feedback
- Include code examples in suggestions
- Praise good patterns
- Prioritize feedback (critical → minor)
- Review tests as thoroughly as code
- Check for security issues (OWASP Top 10 as baseline)

### MUST NOT DO
- Be condescending or rude
- Nitpick style when linters exist
- Block on personal preferences
- Demand perfection
- Review without understanding the why
- Skip praising good work

## Output Template

Code review report must include:
1. **Summary** — One-sentence intent recap + overall assessment
2. **Critical issues** — Must fix before merge (bugs, security, data loss)
3. **Major issues** — Should fix (performance, design, maintainability)
4. **Minor issues** — Nice to have (naming, readability)
5. **Positive feedback** — Specific patterns done well
6. **Questions for author** — Clarifications needed
7. **Verdict** — Approve / Request Changes / Comment

## Knowledge Reference

# Common Issues

## N+1 Query Problem

```typescript
// N+1 queries - BAD
const posts = await Post.findAll();
for (const post of posts) {
  post.author = await User.findById(post.authorId); // N queries!
}

// Single query with join - GOOD
const posts = await Post.findAll({ include: [User] });

// Or batch load
const posts = await Post.findAll();
const authorIds = posts.map(p => p.authorId);
const authors = await User.findByIds(authorIds);
```

## Missing Error Handling

```typescript
// Unhandled rejection - BAD
const data = await fetch('/api/data').then(r => r.json());

// Proper error handling - GOOD
try {
  const response = await fetch('/api/data');
  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error(`HTTP ${response.status}`);
  }
  const data = await response.json();
} catch (error) {
  logger.error('Failed to fetch data', { error });
  throw new DataFetchError('Could not load data');
}
```

## Magic Numbers/Strings

```typescript
// Magic number - BAD
if (user.age >= 18) { ... }
setTimeout(fn, 86400000);

// Named constant - GOOD
const MINIMUM_AGE = 18;
const ONE_DAY_MS = 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000;

if (user.age >= MINIMUM_AGE) { ... }
setTimeout(fn, ONE_DAY_MS);
```

## Deep Nesting

```typescript
// Deep nesting - BAD
if (user) {
  if (user.isActive) {
    if (user.hasPermission) {
      doSomething();
    }
  }
}

// Early returns - GOOD
if (!user || !user.isActive || !user.hasPermission) {
  return;
}
doSomething();
```

## God Functions

```typescript
// Does too much - BAD
async function processOrder(order) {
  // validate
  // check inventory
  // process payment
  // send email
  // update database
  // log analytics
}

// Single responsibility - GOOD
async function processOrder(order) {
  await validateOrder(order);
  await reserveInventory(order);
  await chargePayment(order);
  await sendConfirmation(order);
}
```

## Mutable Shared State

```typescript
// Shared mutable - BAD
const config = { debug: false };
function enableDebug() {
  config.debug = true;
}

// Immutable pattern - GOOD
function createConfig(overrides = {}) {
  return Object.freeze({ debug: false, ...overrides });
}
```

## Missing Null Checks

```typescript
// Unsafe access - BAD
const name = user.profile.name;

// Safe access - GOOD
const name = user?.profile?.name ?? 'Unknown';
```

## Synchronous File Operations

```typescript
// Blocks event loop - BAD
const data = fs.readFileSync('file.txt');

// Non-blocking - GOOD
const data = await fs.promises.readFile('file.txt');
```

## Quick Reference

| Issue | Impact | Fix |
|-------|--------|-----|
| N+1 queries | Performance | Eager load or batch |
| Missing error handling | Reliability | Try/catch + logging |
| Magic numbers | Maintainability | Named constants |
| Deep nesting | Readability | Early returns |
| God functions | Testability | Single responsibility |
| Mutable shared state | Bugs | Immutable patterns |
| Missing null checks | Crashes | Optional chaining |
| Sync file operations | Performance | Async operations |

# Receiving Feedback

---

## Core Mindset

> "Verify before implementing. Ask before assuming. Technical correctness over social comfort."

Code review feedback is a technical discussion, not a social one. Focus on the code, not on feelings.

---

## The Six-Step Process

### Step 1: Read Completely

**Without reacting.** Read the entire comment before forming any response.

```markdown
❌ BAD: Read first sentence → start typing defense
✅ GOOD: Read entire comment → understand full context → then respond
```

### Step 2: Restate Requirements

Rephrase the reviewer's feedback in your own words to confirm understanding.

```markdown
Reviewer: "This function is doing too much. It handles validation,
transformation, and persistence all in one place."

Your restatement: "You're suggesting I split this into three separate
functions: validate(), transform(), and persist()?"
```

### Step 3: Check Against Codebase

Verify the feedback against actual code conditions before responding.

```typescript
// Reviewer says: "This will throw if user is null"

// Check the code:
function getUsername(user: User): string {
  return user.name;  // No null check - reviewer is correct
}

// Or discover context:
function getUsername(user: User): string {
  return user.name;  // TypeScript enforces User, null not possible
}
```

### Step 4: Evaluate Technical Soundness

Consider whether the feedback applies to your specific stack and context.

```markdown
Reviewer: "You should use useMemo here for performance"

Evaluate:
- Is this component re-rendering frequently? → Check React DevTools
- Is the computation expensive? → Profile it
- Does React 19's compiler auto-optimize this? → Check version
```

### Step 5: Respond with Substance

Provide technical acknowledgment or reasoned objection.

```markdown
✅ GOOD: "Fixed. Split into validate(), transform(), persist()
         at lines 24, 45, 67."

✅ GOOD: "Respectfully disagree. This list has max 5 items
         (see schema.ts:12), so filter performance is O(5)."

❌ BAD: "You're absolutely right! Great catch!"
❌ BAD: "I don't think that's necessary."
```

### Step 6: Implement One at a Time

Address each piece of feedback individually with verification.

```markdown
Feedback item 1: Add null check
→ Implement → Test → Commit → Verify → Move to next

Feedback item 2: Extract helper function
→ Implement → Test → Commit → Verify → Move to next

NOT: Try to address all feedback in one massive commit
```

---

## Avoiding Agreement Theater

### The Problem

Performative agreement wastes time and provides no information. When you write "Great point!" you're adding noise, not signal.

### Forbidden Phrases

| Phrase | Why It's Wrong |
|--------|----------------|
| "You're absolutely right!" | Sycophantic, adds no information |
| "Great point!" | Empty praise, not a response |
| "Excellent feedback!" | Flattery, not engagement |
| "Thanks for catching this!" | Unnecessary, just fix it |
| "I really appreciate..." | Social fluff, not technical |

### Actions Demonstrate Understanding

```markdown
❌ "You're absolutely right! Great catch on that null check!
    Thanks so much for pointing this out!"

✅ "Fixed. Added null check at line 42."
```

The code change shows you understood. Words are redundant.

### When Acknowledgment IS Appropriate

Brief, technical acknowledgment when learning something new:

```markdown
✅ "I wasn't aware of that edge case. Added handling at line 42."
✅ "Good point about thread safety. Added mutex at line 67."
```

---

## When to Push Back

### Valid Reasons to Disagree

Push back with technical reasoning when feedback:

| Situation | How to Respond |
|-----------|----------------|
| Breaks existing functionality | "This change would break Feature X (see test at tests/feature-x.spec.ts:34)" |
| Lacks full codebase context | "This pattern exists because of Y (see architecture.md#constraints)" |
| Violates YAGNI | "This flexibility isn't needed yet - only one caller exists" |
| Is technically incorrect | "This actually works because of Z (link to docs)" |
| Conflicts with established architecture | "This conflicts with our JWT approach (see auth/README.md)" |

### Good Pushback Format

```markdown
## Template
This conflicts with [X]. [Evidence]. Was that the intent, or should we [alternative]?

## Example
This conflicts with our JWT authentication architecture (see auth/token.js:45).
Switching to sessions would require restructuring the API middleware.
Was that the intent, or should we keep JWT?
```

### Bad Pushback

```markdown
❌ "I don't think that's right."
❌ "That won't work."
❌ "We've always done it this way."
❌ "That's too much work."
```

---

## Verification Before Claiming Fixed

### The Checklist

Before writing "Fixed" or "Done":

- [ ] Change is implemented
- [ ] Tests pass (full suite, not just changed files)
- [ ] Specific behavior mentioned in feedback is verified
- [ ] Edge cases are tested
- [ ] No unintended side effects introduced

### Acceptable Responses

```markdown
✅ "Fixed. Added null check. Tests pass."
✅ "Fixed at line 42. Verified with test case X."
✅ "Implemented. All 47 tests pass."
```

### Unacceptable Responses

```markdown
❌ "I think this addresses your concern."
❌ "Should be fixed now."
❌ "Done, I believe."
❌ "Fixed (probably)."
```

### When You Can't Verify

If you cannot verify a fix:

```markdown
✅ "Implemented the change, but I'm unable to verify because
    [specific reason]. Can you confirm on your end?"
```

---

## Quick Reference

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Reviewer is correct | "Fixed. [What you changed]." |
| You need clarification | "To confirm: you're suggesting [restatement]?" |
| Reviewer is incorrect | "This works because [evidence]. [Link to proof]." |
| You disagree on approach | "This conflicts with [X]. Should we [alternative]?" |
| You learned something | "I wasn't aware of [X]. Fixed at line [N]." |
| You can't verify | "Implemented. Unable to verify because [reason]." |

---

## Anti-Patterns

| Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Defensive responses | Creates conflict, wastes time | Assume good faith, respond technically |
| Apologetic responses | Unprofessional, adds noise | Just fix it |
| Delayed responses | Blocks review cycle | Respond within hours, not days |
| Vague responses | Leaves reviewer uncertain | Be specific about changes |
| Ignoring feedback | Disrespectful, creates friction | Address every point |

# Report Template

## Full Review Report Template

```markdown
# Code Review: [PR Title]

## Summary
[1-2 sentence overview of the changes and overall assessment]

**Verdict**: [ ] Approve | [x] Request Changes | [ ] Comment

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)

### 1. [File:Line] Security: SQL Injection Risk
- **Current**: String interpolation in query
- **Suggested**: Use parameterized query
- **Impact**: Potential data breach

```typescript
// Current (vulnerable)
const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${id}`;

// Suggested (secure)
const query = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1';
db.query(query, [id]);
```

## Major Issues (Should Fix)

### 1. [File:Line] Performance: N+1 Query
- **Current**: Fetching users in loop
- **Suggested**: Use eager loading with include
- **Impact**: ~100 extra DB queries per request

### 2. [File:Line] Logic: Missing edge case
- **Current**: No handling for empty array
- **Suggested**: Add guard clause
- **Impact**: Potential runtime error

## Minor Issues (Nice to Have)

### 1. [File:Line] Naming: Unclear variable name
- **Current**: `d`
- **Suggested**: `createdDate`

### 2. [File:Line] Style: Inconsistent formatting
- **Current**: Mixed quotes
- **Suggested**: Use single quotes consistently

## Positive Feedback
- Clean separation of concerns in service layer
- Comprehensive input validation on DTOs
- Good test coverage for edge cases
- Excellent error messages

## Questions for Author
- What's the expected behavior when X happens?
- Should this support pagination for large datasets?
- Is the retry logic intentional or accidental?

## Test Coverage Assessment
- [ ] Happy path tested
- [x] Error cases tested
- [ ] Edge cases tested (missing empty array test)

**Critical:** Complete Stage 1 (spec compliance) BEFORE Stage 2 (code quality). Never review code quality for functionality that doesn't meet the specification.

---

## Stage 1: Spec Compliance Review

### Core Directive

> "The implementer finished suspiciously quickly. Their report may be incomplete, inaccurate, or optimistic."

Approach every review with professional skepticism. Verify claims independently.

### The Three Verification Categories

#### Category 1: Missing Requirements

**Check for features that were requested but not implemented.**

| Question | How to Verify |
|----------|---------------|
| Did they skip requested features? | Compare PR to original requirements line by line |
| Are edge cases handled? | Check error paths, empty states, boundaries |
| Were error scenarios addressed? | Look for try/catch, error boundaries, validation |
| Is the happy path complete? | Trace through primary use case manually |

```markdown
## Example Review Finding

**Missing Requirement:** Issue #42 requested "password must be at least 8 characters"

**Found in code:**
```typescript
// No length validation present
function validatePassword(password: string) {
  return password.length > 0;  // Only checks non-empty
}
```

**Status:** ❌ Incomplete - minimum length validation missing
```

#### Category 2: Unnecessary Additions

**Check for scope creep and over-engineering.**

| Question | How to Verify |
|----------|---------------|
| Features beyond specification? | Compare to original requirements |
| Over-engineering? | Is complexity justified by requirements? |
| Premature optimization? | Is performance cited without measurements? |
| Unrequested abstractions? | Are there helpers/utils for one-time use? |

```markdown
## Example Review Finding

**Unnecessary Addition:** Added caching layer not in requirements

**Found in code:**
```typescript
// Original requirement: "Fetch user by ID"
// Actual implementation:
class CachedUserRepository {  // Not requested
  private cache = new Map();
  private ttl = 60000;

  async getUser(id: string) {
    if (this.cache.has(id)) { ... }
    // 50 lines of cache logic
  }
}
```

**Status:** ⚠️ Scope creep - discuss before merging
```

#### Category 3: Interpretation Gaps

**Check for misunderstandings of requirements.**

| Question | How to Verify |
|----------|---------------|
| Different understanding of requirements? | Ask author to explain their interpretation |
| Unclarified assumptions? | Look for comments like "assuming..." |
| Ambiguous specs resolved incorrectly? | Compare to similar existing features |

```markdown
## Example Review Finding

**Interpretation Gap:** "Sort by date" implemented as ascending

**Requirement stated:** "Sort by date" (ambiguous)

**Author implemented:** Oldest first (ascending)

**Expected:** Most recent first is typical UX pattern

**Status:** ❓ Clarify - which sort order was intended?
```

---

## Why Order Matters

### Stage 1 Must Come First

| Scenario | Waste from Wrong Order |
|----------|------------------------|
| Skip Stage 1 | Review 500 lines of code quality, then discover wrong feature was built |
| Stage 2 First | Suggest refactoring, then realize the code shouldn't exist |
| Combined | Mix concerns, miss systematic issues |

### Separation of Concerns

- **Stage 1 (Spec):** Does it do the right thing?
- **Stage 2 (Quality):** Does it do the thing right?

Code quality review is meaningless if the code doesn't implement the correct functionality.

## Spec Compliance Checklist

### Before You Start

- [ ] Read the original issue/ticket completely
- [ ] Identify all explicit requirements
- [ ] Identify implicit requirements from context
- [ ] Note any acceptance criteria listed

### During Review

**Missing Requirements:**
- [ ] All required features present
- [ ] Edge cases covered (empty, null, max values)
- [ ] Error handling as specified
- [ ] Happy path fully functional
- [ ] UI matches mockups/specs if provided

**Unnecessary Additions:**
- [ ] No unrequested features
- [ ] No speculative abstractions
- [ ] No premature optimizations
- [ ] Scope matches requirements exactly

**Interpretation Gaps:**
- [ ] Author's understanding matches spec
- [ ] Ambiguities resolved correctly
- [ ] Assumptions are documented and valid
- [ ] Behavior matches similar existing features

### After Review

- [ ] Document all findings with file:line references
- [ ] Categorize as missing/unnecessary/interpretation
- [ ] Prioritize: blocking vs. non-blocking issues

## Output Format

### Compliant Result

```markdown
## Spec Compliance Review: ✅ PASS

All requirements verified:
- ✅ User can upload profile image (req #1)
- ✅ Image resized to 200x200 (req #2)
- ✅ Invalid formats rejected with error message (req #3)
- ✅ Progress indicator during upload (req #4)

**Proceed to:** Code Quality Review
```

### Issues Found

```markdown
## Spec Compliance Review: ❌ ISSUES FOUND

### Missing Requirements

1. **Progress indicator not implemented** (req #4)
   - File: `ProfileUpload.tsx`
   - Expected: Progress bar during upload
   - Found: No progress indication

2. **Error messages not user-friendly** (req #3)
   - File: `ProfileUpload.tsx:45`
   - Expected: "Please upload a JPG or PNG file"
   - Found: "Error: INVALID_FORMAT"

### Unnecessary Additions

1. **Image cropping feature not requested**
   - File: `ImageCropper.tsx` (new file, 150 lines)
   - Impact: Adds complexity, delays delivery
   - Recommendation: Remove or create separate PR

**Action Required:** Address missing requirements before code quality review
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Why It's Wrong |
|---------|----------------|
| Reviewing code style before spec compliance | Wasted effort if wrong thing was built |
| Assuming spec was followed | Verify independently |
| Skipping edge cases | Bugs hide in boundaries |
| Accepting "we can add it later" | Technical debt accumulates |
| Missing scope creep | Unreviewed code enters codebase |
